<p>We encourage you to <strong>spread the word</strong> about your <strong>Private-Public Concert</strong>. A good idea is to create a Facebook event for your concert - then it is easy to invite friends.</p>

<p>As a host you need to download the films you want to screen from the vimeo page of each film. You can email me if you have troubles during this process</p>

<p>If you would like to use a DVD player to screen the films then you can burn a playable DVD using a DVD burner application.
The easiest is to play the films via your computer. You can either connect it to a projector or one of those modern TVs, or simply screen it on your computerÂ´s screen.</p>
<p>Please remember that my films are music films. I encourage you to make sure that you can screen the film properly and with good and clear sound.</p>
